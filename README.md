fully-automatic on-chain pump.fun solana MEVbot leveraging flashloans and the minimal gas fees of Solana to perform sandwich attacks and front-runs on https://pump.fun. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the atomic nature of Flashloan operations, if they aren't profitable the transaction will revert and no net profit will be lost.

# Components

-- onchain solana program

-- website dashboard

# Operation
```mermaid
graph LR
A[MEVBOT] --Identify TX -->C(Mev Buy)--> E(Target Buy)
E --> F(Mev Sell)
F -->J(no arb)
J--tx reverted -->A
F --> H(arbitrage) --profit --> A
```
- The bot is constantly sniffing the https://pump.fun Solana master SPL for user buys, sells, and token creations containing slippage deficits.
> [!TIP]
> Bot operators can target any transaction value within their balance threshold. Generally, higher thresholds net consistently viable transactions
-  Once a transaction is identified, a flashloan is initiated for the target transaction amount, this requires a marginal amount of collateral.
-  The bot will aggresively attempt to front-run the transaction by dynamically monitoring the bribe to the miner and increasing it if necessary so as to be the first transaction mined.
- Depending on the set parameters, the bot will either front-run the Dev's sell to remain in profit, or sell upon the token reaching KOTH.
- The flashloan is then repaid, collateral is reiumbursed and profits are deposited into the operators wallet.
-  If the transaction is unprofitable at any point it will be reverted and the flashloan will be repaid, losing no gas or net profit.

4.  If you are using your own deployed Mev Engine along with the dashboard, don't forget to paste your program's SPL address into the `program_address` variable.
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  skip this step if you arent deploying your own program, and want your dashboard to connect to the **ORCA** public MEV program for a .1% trading fee! 
4. Visit https://pump.fun

5. Open the Greasemonkey or Violentmonkey extension

6. Click `+ create new script` or `new user script`

# Tips

- If the dashboard is enabled but not appearing; some chrome-based browsers must have developer mode enabled, you can find the toggle in the top right of the extensions page. 

- Increase the flashloan limit by .5 - 1 SOL if you wish to target more than one or two coins at a time.
